<h1 align="center">Good morning!</h1>

<p align="justify">
      I'm a <b>software developer</b>, trying to improve myself sometimes and most of times obsessing myself into a project. Whether you consider this bad or not is up to you lmao.
  <br><br>I like playing videogames, coding and pretty much it. 
  <br>I'm a simple guy who enjoys simple things, laughs at random memes and tries to be friendly with people, altho I'm not very good with socialising, I try my best to at least.
  have some normal convo and make you laugh from time to time.
<br><br>I program almost 100% in <b>Haxe</b>, an <b>open-source programming language</b>, aiming to be a <b>successor of ActionScript</b>. <b>High-level and crossplatform</b>, which is very useful if you have one piece of code in haxe and you wanna port to <b>JS, C++, Java, Python</b>, etc. Not to mention, you can use <b>"libraries"</b> which consists of <b>code that you can inject</b> on a <b>Haxe project</b> for several reasons: Maybe you need some util functions that can ease your workflow, or maybe it's an entire game engine which then you can use to create your own games!
I personally use <b>HaxeFlixel</b>, a game engine that has been built on top of <b>OpenFL</b>: a framework that replicates all the API of <b>Flash</b> to make games!
