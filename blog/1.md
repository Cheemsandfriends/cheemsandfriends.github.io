Now, you may be wondering...

# Why a whole ass website??

Honestly, it's just that simple:

1. I get more knowledge in web building stuff
2. I can do my own silly personal announcements
3. Why not?

it's all wins here, so I'll take the W and build whatever I want, bleh!

plus... wouldn't it be cool to just get a bit of insight of me? My thoughts and all I mean...
hehehe Idk idkkkkk
Also, this is one of the many things I have made in the dark, I had to take a break after uhhh...personal and business affairs *ehem ehem*

I'm sorry I was gone, but hey! I got you some [content]({{ "content preview.mp3" | getAsset }})!

So I hope my... absence wasn't bothersome, if you were even worried lol

now...

# What are my plans with this website?

Purely personal, just putting shit that I like in here, fuse it with some personal projects I have, and overall what the voices on my head tell me to post or ramble about, honestly heh...
